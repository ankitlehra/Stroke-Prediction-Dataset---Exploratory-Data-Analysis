Exploratory Data Analysis on Stroke Prediction Dataset
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various statistical tests performed on a dataset focused on stroke prediction. The analysis includes linear and logistic regression models, univariate descriptive analysis, ANOVA, and chi-square tests, among others. The dataset provides insights into factors such as age, work type, smoking status, hypertension, and marital status, and their potential impact on the likelihood of stroke.
